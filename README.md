# Mnemion

Persistent, evolving shared knowledge management between a human and their AI agents.

Every conversation with an AI agent starts cold. Mnemion gives each session access to a shared history of thinking and problem solving — read, write, search, and reshape — so context from yesterday's Claude.ai chat, this morning's Claude Code run, and tomorrow's API agent all share the same memory. It runs as an MCP and HTTP server on Cloudflare Workers.

One click clones the repo to your account, provisions the resources, and deploys. You set one secret (`MNEMION_SECRET`), then register a passkey at `/setup`. Details under [**Deploy to Cloudflare**](#deploy-to-cloudflare) below.

## How it works

### The model

- **Hive** — the whole store (one per user — optionally shared by several people as members)
- **Pattern** — an organizing structure, like a table (e.g. `tasks`, `decisions`, `people`)
- **Entry** — an instance within a pattern (a single row)
- **Facet** — a typed dimension of an entry (a column)
- **Link** — a typed connection between entries (a foreign key)

Mnemion ships **empty**. There is no prescribed schema. The first conversation creates the first pattern based on what actually needs to happen. The structure that emerges after a month encodes what matters in *this* working relationship.

### The first conversation

There's no onboarding flow — you just talk:

> **You:** We decided to use Postgres over SQLite for the sync service. Worth remembering.
>
> **Agent:** I'll set up a `decisions` pattern for this kind of thing. *(calls `propose_change`, shows you the preview, commits with `apply_change`, then `mutate`s the entry in)*

A week later, in a different client:

> **You:** Remind me why we went with Postgres?
>
> **Agent:** *(calls `prime` with the conversational context; the decision surfaces)* You chose it over SQLite for the sync service because…

### The agent surface

Eight MCP tools, scoped to act on entries of any shape:

| Tool | What it's for |
|------|---------------|
| `prime` | Auto-associative recall. Pass the current conversational focus as 1–3 natural sentences; get back the most relevant entries across all patterns ranked by semantic similarity, plus their one-hop links. Relevance is weighted at read time: superseded entries are demoted and annotated, and patterns with a memory-policy half-life decay when neither updated nor recalled. Embedding-based — descriptive language beats keyword lists. |
| `mutate` | All writes. Create, update, patch (edit text in place without resending the whole facet), archive, unarchive. Batchable up to 100 ops atomically. Supports optimistic locking via version field for concurrent-surface safety. Creating an entry that semantically overlaps an existing one (or duplicates an exclusive facet) returns a `possible_overlap` advisory — never a block. |
| `query` | Filtered, sorted, paginated reads from a single pattern. Operators: `= != > < >= <= ~ |=`. The `|=` operator does IN-list lookups (`id|=1,3,7`) for batched multi-id reads. `count_only` mode for fast counts. |
| `search` | Cross-pattern FTS over all text facets. Use when you don't know which pattern holds the answer. |
| `resolve` | Read anything by URI. Supports `mnemion://` URIs, federated cross-hive URIs (e.g. `mnemion://other.hive.dev/entry/axioms/7`), and `https://` URLs — the last fetches and caches web pages and Bluesky threads so they're available to future `prime` recalls. |
| `propose_change` | Two-phase schema evolution, phase one. Validates a structural change and returns a preview without committing. |
| `apply_change` | Two-phase schema evolution, phase two. Commits a previously proposed change. Also handles point-in-time *revert* — restores all data (not just schema) to before a given history entry. |
| `render` | Visual twin of the read tools. Returns a rich UI table (`view=patterns` or `view=entries`) via an MCP-Apps fragment in capable hosts, with a text fallback everywhere else. |

Tool metadata is centralized in `entities/Session/tools.ts` and powers both the MCP server registration and the in-app help view.

### What resources agents read

MCP resources are stable, cacheable, subscribable URIs that agents read for orientation:

- `mnemion://index` — master index: every pattern, its purpose, current state. First read of every session.
- `mnemion://schema/{pattern}` — facet definitions for a pattern.
- `mnemion://entry/{pattern}/{id}` — a single entry.
- `mnemion://history` — schema change log.
- `mnemion://stale` — entries past their staleness horizon (neither updated nor recalled recently); the review surface for maintenance passes. Supports `?days=N`.
- `mnemion://_system/{slug}` — agent-facing system docs (tools, schema-evolution, skills, conventions, memory-maintenance).

After `apply_change`, the server emits `notifications/tools/list_changed` so long-lived clients re-read.

### Schema evolution as a first-class operation

Creating a pattern, adding a facet, archiving an old pattern — all happen mid-conversation through `propose_change` → preview → `apply_change`. Supported change types:

- `create_pattern` — new pattern with facets, links to other patterns
- `add_facet` — extend an existing pattern
- `set_sharing` — toggle an entry's HTTP visibility (public / unlisted / private)
- `set_options` / `set_doctrine` — per-pattern config and prose guidance
- `set_memory_policy` — per-pattern recall hygiene: `{half_life_days, conflict_check, exclusive_facets}`
- `archive_pattern` / `unarchive_pattern`

Mistakes are recoverable. `apply_change` with `revert_history_id` restores the full hive state to before any change in the schema log.

### Auto-associative recall

`prime` is the headline feature. On every `mutate`, Mnemion generates an embedding via Workers AI (`@cf/baai/bge-base-en-v1.5`) and upserts it into a Vectorize index. When an agent calls `prime` with the current conversational focus, Mnemion embeds the focus and KNN-searches the index for the most relevant entries, then expands them one hop along links.

The result: agents don't need to know what to ask for. They describe the moment; the hive surfaces what's near it.

Raw similarity isn't the whole ranking. Relevance is weighted at read time, derived fresh from stored truth:

- **Supersession** — an entry targeted by an active `supersedes` link is demoted (×0.3) and annotated with `superseded_by`. Current truth outranks replaced truth, but the chain stays navigable — nothing is hidden.
- **Decay** — in patterns whose memory policy sets a half-life, relevance is multiplied by `0.5^(age / half_life)`, floored so old-but-relevant can still surface. Age counts from the entry's *last touch*: the later of its last update and its last prime hit (recall is rehearsal — being remembered keeps an entry fresh). Patterns without a policy never decay.

Short-term hits are logged to `_fragment_access_log`. Repeated retrieval promotes a fragment to `_long_term_fragments` — the count is derived from the log, never stored separately. User-pattern hits are logged to `_entry_access_log`, which feeds decay and the stale view.

### Memory maintenance

A hive that only accumulates eventually whispers stale things back. Mnemion counters contradiction and staleness with owner-ratified, read-time-derived mechanisms — nothing auto-deletes:

- **Supersession links** record that one entry replaced another (`mutate(pattern: "link", data: {source, target, label: "supersedes"})`).
- **Write-time overlap advisories** surface near-duplicates at create time so the contradiction is caught when it's born, not when it's recalled.
- **Per-pattern memory policy** (`set_memory_policy`) makes decay and conflict behavior owner-tunable — journals fade fast, axioms never. Agents are taught to *propose* policies as patterns reveal their nature; the owner ratifies.
- **`mnemion://stale`** lists entries past their staleness horizon for review.
- **Maintenance passes** are recorded in `_maintenance_passes`; "days since last pass" (default interval 14 days, charter-overridable) is announced to connecting agents in MCP instructions *and* in prime responses, with a prompt to offer the owner a cleanup pass.

### HTTP I/O and federation

Patterns can grow HTTP endpoints. Five kinds of agent-defined I/O, all expressed as entries:

- **Publications** (`_publications`) — live projections of pattern data rendered at request time at `GET /p/{path}`, as HTML, RSS, JSON, or Markdown. The hive's people-facing publishing surface — detailed in [Publishing](#publishing-the-publication-surface) below.
- **Documents** (`_documents`) — an R2-backed file store (**optional — requires R2; see [below](#document-storage-requires-r2-optional)**). A `_documents` entry holds agent-defined metadata (title, description, tags, visibility); the bytes live in R2, never in the hive. Creating an entry returns a single-use `upload_url`; you `POST` the file (≤25 MB) and it's served at `GET /f/{id}`, gated by the entry's visibility. Archiving the entry deletes the blob. Making a file non-private is consent-gated.
- **Shared entries** (`_shared`) — flip an entry to `public` and it becomes readable at `/o/entry/{pattern}/{id}`, edge-cached. Flip to `unlisted` and it's readable by anyone with an auth-code token.
- **Egress** (`_outputs`) — agent-constructed static responses at arbitrary `/o/{path}` URLs.
- **Ingress** (`_inputs`) — `POST /i/{path}` endpoints accept inbound data and create entries in target patterns, with an optional declarative transform DSL to map incoming fields.

**Federation** is a property of `resolve`: any URI whose first path segment contains a dot is treated as a foreign hostname. `mnemion://other.hive.dev/entry/axioms/7` becomes a GET to `https://other.hive.dev/o/entry/axioms/7`. It's **consent-gated**: `resolve` refuses a cross-hive URI — and never sends a token — unless you've allow-listed the peer host first (an active `_federation_hosts` entry, added through a confirmation round-trip); loopback/private/metadata hosts are blocked outright (SSRF). Once a host is allow-listed, private access is granted via `?token=<code>` (auth code → Bearer header), re-validated on every redirect hop. No federation protocol — sovereign hives, voluntary connections, edge-cached public responses.

### Publishing: the publication surface

Mnemion is knowledge management, not just memory — and some knowledge is most useful shared. Federation handles hive→hive sharing (machine to machine); **publications** handle hive→people. A `_publications` entry declares a path, a source query, and a transport, and the worker renders **live pattern data at request time** at `GET /p/{path}`. Nothing rendered is ever stored, so a published page can never go stale relative to its underlying entries.

```
mutate _publications create {
  "path": "now",
  "title": "What I'm working on",
  "source_pattern": "tasks",
  "filters": "[\"status=in-progress\"]",
  "format": "html"
}
```

- **Four opinionated transports**: `html` (semantic single-page, system fonts, light/dark, no JS), `rss` (RSS 2.0 with RFC-822 dates and `mnemion://` guids), `json` (a `{title, count, entries}` envelope), and `markdown` (with **YAML frontmatter** — title, path, source_pattern, generated_at, count — so it drops straight into static-site pipelines and agent ingestion).
- **Two seams on the HTML output**: a per-entry `{{facet}}` template (plus `{{_label}}`, `{{_uri}}`, `{{_id}}`, `{{_updated_at}}` — template text passes through raw, substituted values are HTML-escaped) and a `css` facet appended after the default styles.
- **Current truth by default**: entries demoted by a `supersedes` link are excluded unless `include_superseded` is set — public projections show what's current, not what was replaced.
- **Consent-gated**: creating a publication serves every current and future entry its query matches, so the `mutate` requires an explicit confirmation round-trip. Source must be a user pattern — kernel patterns (tokens, sharing config, etc.) are never publishable.
- **Visibility**: `public` (edge-cached ~60s) / `unlisted` (requires a bearer token with `read:publication:{path}` scope) / `private` (staged, not served).

Where `_outputs` serves static content you wrote, a publication is a *live projection* — the difference between a snapshot and a window.

### Document storage requires R2 (optional)

The document store is the one capability with an external dependency: **Cloudflare R2**, which is off by default on new accounts. **Mnemion runs fully without it** — every other capability (memory, prime, query, search, publications, sharing, ingress, federation, the web UI) works with no R2. Only `/f` file upload and serving are unavailable until you turn R2 on.

To enable it:

1. **Enable R2** in the Cloudflare dashboard → **Storage & databases → R2** (a one-time account toggle; adds a payment method, but usage stays in R2's free tier — 10 GB, $0 egress). This is the only manual step — no CLI can flip an account-level toggle.
2. `npm run enable-documents` — creates the bucket and wires the binding for you.
3. `npm run deploy`.

The binding ships **commented out** because a binding to a non-existent bucket fails deploy — that's what keeps Mnemion deployable on a fresh account. `npm run enable-documents` uncomments it after the bucket exists (and tells you to enable R2 first if you haven't). Until then, creating a `_documents` entry still succeeds (and returns a note that uploads are unavailable), `POST /f` returns `503`, and connecting agents are told document storage is off so they can flag it to you.

**Search story — metadata *and* contents.** A document's metadata (title, description, tags) is a normal entry, covered by `search` and surfaced in `prime`. And on upload the file's **text is extracted** into the `extracted_text` facet (text-family inline; PDFs via `unpdf` in the background) and the entry is re-embedded — so document **contents** join both the full-text index (`search`) and the embedding index (`prime`). `extraction_status` reports `done` / `pending` / `failed` / `unsupported`. (Chunked embeddings for very long documents are a future refinement.)

### Web URL adapters

`resolve` accepts `https://` URLs too. Bluesky threads are fetched via the AT Protocol API (no scraping). Anything else goes through Cloudflare Browser Rendering. Results are cached per-adapter with TTLs in `_web_cache`, and the cached content participates in `prime`'s embedding index — so web pages an agent reads today surface in tomorrow's recalls.

### Skills distribution (plugin marketplace)

Mnemion can serve itself as a Claude Code **plugin marketplace** — and, true to the rest of the system, skills are just entries. Two patterns carry it: `_plugins` (a named package with a semver `version`, a `visibility`, and optional `claude_md` / `settings_json` / `mcp_json`) and `_skills` (a `skill_md` body plus frontmatter fields, linked to a plugin via `plugin_id`). Create both through normal schema evolution the first time you need them, then author skills with `mutate` — no git repo, no static files, no build step.

The marketplace is **emergent**, not a stored artifact. `GET /marketplace.git/*` reads `_plugins` / `_skills` through the same `query` RPC any agent uses and projects them through a git adapter (`src/git.ts`) into a Smart-HTTP packfile on every request. Claude Code clones it like any other marketplace repo:

```
# Public — unauthenticated, serves only fully-public plugins
/plugin marketplace add https://<host>/marketplace/public

# Private — Basic auth with a marketplace-scoped token, serves everything
/plugin marketplace add https://mnemion:<token>@<host>/marketplace.git
```

- **Split serving by visibility.** The public endpoint lists a plugin only if *every* skill in it is public — one private skill hides the whole plugin, so there's no partial exposure. The private endpoint serves all visibility levels and is gated by an `_access_tokens` entry with `marketplace` scope, optionally constrained to specific plugin names.
- **Versioning works through the `version` facet.** Each `_plugins` entry carries a semver `version`, and it flows verbatim into both `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (per plugin) and that plugin's `plugin.json` — the two files Claude Code's auto-update compares to decide whether to pull. Bump `version` when you change a skill and clients pick up the new `skill_md` on next startup. The bump is **manual** (agent- or human-driven via `mutate`); the worker does not auto-increment — auto-versioning is a deliberately deferred question (see [`project-docs/archived/skill-delivery.md`](project-docs/archived/skill-delivery.md)), since auto-bumping on every typo would push an update to every client.

Because a skill's `skill_md` is just a record, a skill can teach an agent how to use *this* hive — stored in Mnemion, served by Mnemion, operating on Mnemion. Agent-facing reference: `mnemion://_system/skills`.

### The web UI

The web app is a **React + Vite** single-page app, served by the worker as static assets — a pattern browser and entry editor with live updates over WebSocket: a `mutate` broadcasts a granular delta that patches a single entry in a normalized client store, so only that one card re-renders.

**Agent-authored, customizable pages.** Each pattern's page is rendered from an optional **view spec** the agent writes *as data* into the `_views` pattern — no code, no deploy. A spec picks a `view_type` from a fixed palette and maps the pattern's facets to UI roles:

- **`cards`** — a responsive grid (the default).
- **`board`** — Kanban columns grouped by a facet (`group_by`); cards drag between columns and the move writes back.
- **`table`** — rows with columns mapped to facets.
- **`list`** — compact rows.

The palette is a fixed set of React components (`web/src/views.tsx`); the spec is declarative data interpreted against it. So an agent can lay out a pattern's UI mid-conversation by writing a `_views` entry — the same "structure is data" discipline as schema evolution, applied to the interface.

Browser sessions authenticate via passkey-backed OAuth; the session cookie also gates the API endpoints the UI uses. (The one non-React web surface is the MCP `render` fragment — plain TS, embedded in MCP-Apps-capable hosts.)

### Auth model

Layered, behind OAuth 2.1 with PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration:

- **Master secret** — high-entropy random hex, set by `npm run setup`. The bootstrap credential and the fallback for headless agents. With no secret set, the instance **fails closed**.
- **Passkey** (WebAuthn) — convenience layer for browser-based OAuth. Registered once via the URL `npm run setup` prints. Replaces the master secret for normal use.
- **Access tokens** (`_access_tokens`) — scoped bearer tokens with hierarchical prefix matching (`*`, `read` / `read:entry:axioms:7`, `write`, `upload`, `document`, `marketplace`, `register`). Used by remote agents, single-use uploads, federated peers, and the private plugin marketplace. Tokens are stored **hashed** (the raw value is shown once, at mint), and minting a broad/portable scope is consent-gated.

**One hive, several people.** A hive has a `_members` roster — an `owner` plus members, each with a role and `active`/`suspended` status. Inviting someone is a deliberate, in-person act: an agent creates the member and mints a single-use `register` token, but the token is **inert** until an existing member approves it at `/invite/{token}` with their passkey — only then can the invitee register their own passkey at `/setup`. Every write is attributed (`created_by`/`updated_by`) to the member who made it; suspending or archiving a member stops their logins and tokens.

### Architecture in one paragraph

A single Cloudflare Worker hosts everything. Two Durable Objects: **SessionDO** (one per MCP session, runs the protocol) and **HiveDO** (one per user, owns all SQLite storage — patterns, entries, facets, links, audit logs, the works). Embeddings are generated by Workers AI on every mutate and live in Vectorize; OAuth tokens live in KV. See [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the component map and the design principles ("data is destiny," "code as schematic") that govern the codebase.

## Deploy to Cloudflare

### One-click

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/daniloc/mnemion/tree/main/mnemion-js)

Clicking the button clones the repo to your own GitHub, provisions the resources
(KV is auto-provisioned; the Vectorize index is created by the build step), wires
up CI/CD via Workers Builds, and deploys. You'll be prompted for one secret,
**`MNEMION_SECRET`** — paste a high-entropy value (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`).
This is required: with no secret set, the instance **fails closed** — `/authorize`
and the owner APIs return `503` and nothing is usable until you set it. (Dev-mode
auto-approve is a separate, explicit `DEV=true` opt-in that a real deploy never sets.)

After it deploys, register your owner passkey **once**:

```
https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/setup?token=<the MNEMION_SECRET you set>
```

That's the only manual step — passkey registration has to happen in your browser,
on your device. After that, browser login uses the passkey and the secret is your
headless/fallback credential. (Document storage still needs R2 — see *Document
storage requires R2* above — but everything else works immediately.)

### Or, from a clone (CLI)

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (required by Wrangler 4)
- A Cloudflare account (Wrangler will prompt for browser login on first use)
- `openssl` (preinstalled on macOS and most Linux distros)

#### One command

From the repo root:

```bash
npm run setup
```

`npm run setup` is idempotent. It:

1. Finds or creates the `mnemion-vectors` Vectorize index (768 dims, cosine — matches the Workers AI `bge-base-en-v1.5` embedding model)
2. Generates a 256-bit master secret and pushes it as `MNEMION_SECRET`
3. Builds the MCP render fragment and deploys the worker — the `OAUTH_KV` namespace is auto-provisioned on this first deploy (no id needed in `wrangler.toml`) and stays linked thereafter
4. Pins `WORKER_HOST` to the deployed host and redeploys — the instance treats `WORKER_HOST` as the authoritative host for every generated URL (`upload_url` / `page_url` / `og_image`) and ignores the inbound `Host` header when it's set, so a spoofed `Host` can't poison a capability URL
5. Prints (and optionally opens) a one-time URL: `https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/setup?token=<secret>`

Open that URL once in a browser to register a passkey. After that, browser-based OAuth uses the passkey; the master secret remains as a fallback for headless agents and re-registration.

#### Optional: rename the worker

By default the worker deploys as `mnemion`. If you want a different subdomain (or you already have a worker by that name on your account), edit `name` and `WORKER_HOST` in `mnemion-js/wrangler.toml` before running setup.

### Connect an MCP client

Your MCP endpoint is:

```
https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/mcp
```

Add it to Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any MCP client that supports remote servers with OAuth. The first connection opens the OAuth flow in a browser; your passkey authorizes it.

## Subsequent deploys

Code changes only — no secret rotation, no re-registration:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Re-running `npm run setup` rotates the master secret and replaces your passkey.

## Local development

```bash
npm run dev        # concurrently: wrangler dev (worker + DOs, seeded) + Vite HMR for the React app — open the Vite URL
npm test           # vitest suite (runs in workerd via @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers)
```

For React-app-only iteration: `cd mnemion-js && npm run dev:app`.

The dev scripts pass `--var DEV:true` — the **explicit** opt-in for dev-mode OAuth auto-approve (`Auth.DEV`), so locally you can hit the worker without a passkey or secret. A real deploy never sets `DEV`, so the same secretless state fails closed in production.
